## Later Versions

### The Hill 🌼
1. Save events you like and find them back on your user interface.
    - Users column: saves (an array with event_id's?).
    - When clicked on save -> add to array 
    - ... & the other way around: unsave  
    - When a event is deleted, remove it also from the saves 
    - Display saved events on personal page.
2. Generate a special link for an event you would like to share trough other platforms


### The Mountain 🌳
1. Make a difference between public and private events
    - Make a event table for each
    - Decide who can see those events ~= invite people

2. Make a Profile Setting tab 
    - add option to receive invitations from friend via mail by adding your email anounimously! (SHOW/HIDE function)


## Later features / ideas
- Possibility to choose the font you write your titles when you create an event (LOTS OF OPTIONS WOULD BE COOL!)
- when you make a public event, it means not everyone can see it but all the people who 'follow' you!
- Register/login as a Organisator (No contacts(?), only possible to be followed, create events, see some stats, panel for your event, panel for events actually also with other organisations you follow)
- choose an emoji that displays with your name
- add your email adress -> hide OR visible for your contacts.
In your contact you can then see the email adress of (some) contacts, click on it and send an email, yihaaa! -> in't begin met intention friends gewoon zowieso email adres vragen...
- invited peoplez da ni in uw contacten zitten (als organisator) mogen iets vetter staan.
